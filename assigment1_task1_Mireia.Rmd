# **Task 1 (individual): Data wrangling & visualization (showshoe hares)**

For Task 1 you will wrangle, then create a final visualization and summary table, of physical characteristics for snowshoe hares observed in Bonanza Creek Experimental Forest. 

**Data**: download showshoe_data.csv [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1d4LGOzyXHuQztwVQjU8IdmVvzRACVps4/view?usp=sharing)

You get to decide what variables and summary statistics to visualize. 

Here’s what you should prepare: 

A single polished HTML (knitted from .Rmd), planning that this might be a post/project you’d include on your personal blogdown site, that includes at least:

1.	A useful descriptive introductory summary (3 - 4 sentences) of what’s contained in the project

Snowshoe hares, *Lepus americanus*, are a 'keystone' prey species in northern boreal forests and experience population fluctuations of 8-11-years. Despite intense responses of both vegetation and predators to changes in hare densities, landscape-scale comparisons of hare populations in Alaska have been limited to qualitative descriptions. We conducted capture-recapture studies of snowshoe hares at 5 locales in the Tanana valley, from Tok in the east to Clear in the west from 1999 to 2002. 

2.	Image(s), with captions and necessary citation(s), of showshoe hares and/or a map of the study area


![snowshoe hares](images/images.jpg)


3.	All of your organized and well-annotated code (with warnings/messages hidden) used to create at least:

-	One finalized graph about the Bonanza Creek snowshoe hare population (you pick which variables, how you want to wrangle it beforehand, and which type of visual to create - but make sure it is beautifully finalized)

## Load libraries
```{r}
library(here) #constructs paths to your project's files 
library(tidyverse) #data wrangling
library(kableExtra) #to make html tables
library(skimr) #for summarizing the data
library(lubridate)#change dates
library(naniar)#to explore missing values
library(VIM)#to explore missing values
```

## Loading the data

```{r}
snowshoes <- read_csv("task1/showshoe_lter.csv")
#snowshoes <- read_csv(here("task1", "showshoe_lter.csv"))
```

## Exploring and wrangling the data

Summarizing
```{r}
head(snowshoes)
summary(snowshoes)
unique(snowshoes$grid)
unique(snowshoes$sex)
skim(snowshoes)
```
Clean up: 
1) names of the species and sex columns to lowercase
```{r}
snowshoes_clean <- snowshoes %>% 
    mutate(
      grid = str_to_lower(grid),
      sex = str_to_lower(sex))
```
2) convert `date` column to yr_mo_day and create new column with year with `lubridate`
```{r}
snowshoes_clean_date <- snowshoes_clean %>% 
  mutate(yr_mo_day = lubridate::parse_date_time(date, "%m/%d/%y")) %>% 
  mutate(year = year(yr_mo_day))
```
Exploring the results
```{r}
unique(snowshoes_clean_date$grid)
unique(snowshoes_clean_date$sex)
```
3) convert `grid` column to species
```{r}
snowshoes_clean_species <- snowshoes_clean_date %>% 
  mutate(species = "Lepus americanus")
```

Selecting only f and m sex classes
```{r}
snowshoes_clean_sex <- snowshoes_clean_species %>% 
    filter(sex == "f" | sex == "m")
```
Exploring the results
```{r}
unique(snowshoes_clean_sex$sex)
```
Exploring NA's using naniar::gg_miss_var()
```{r}
gg_miss_var(snowshoes_clean_sex)
```
Use tidyr::drop_na() to keep complete cases 
```{r}
snowshoes_final <- snowshoes_clean_sex %>% 
  drop_na(weight)
```
Select columns that we want to keep for visualization
```{r}
snowshoes_final <- snowshoes_final %>% 
  select(sex, weight, date, year)
```

## Create new data for visualization

```{r}
snowshoes_count <- snowshoes_final %>% 
  group_by(year, sex) %>% 
  summarize(n = n())

snowshoes_weigth <- snowshoes_final %>% 
  group_by(year, sex) %>% 
  summarize(mean = mean(weight))
            
```

## Visualizing

```{r}
ggplot(snowshoes_final, aes(x = sex, y = weight)) +
  geom_jitter(size = 1,
              alpha = 0.5,
              aes(color = sex,
                  pch = sex)) +
    scale_color_manual(values = c("blue","orange"))

```


```{r}
snowshoes_count_gg <- ggplot(data = snowshoes_count, aes(x = year, y = n, group = sex)) +
  geom_line(aes(color = sex)) +
  theme_minimal()


snowshoes_count_gg 
```


-	One finalized HTML table (probably created using kable & kableExtra) containing summary statistics about the snowshoe hares (again, you pick which variables, and how you want to group/summarize them)

```{r}

snowshoes_table <- snowshoes_weigth %>% 
  mutate("Mean weigth (kg)" = round(mean / 1e3, 2)) %>% 
  rename("Year" = year) %>% 
  mutate(sex = recode (sex, 
                         `m`="Male",
                         `f`="Female")) %>% 
  select(-mean) 


kable(snowshoes_table) %>% 
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "striped", 
                full_width = FALSE) 
```



4.	Make sure that both your figure and table appear in your final knitted document, each with a useful caption. Include text associated with each to help the audience understand and interpret the results.
